Django manages the database operations with the ORM(Object Relational Mapping) technique. Migration refers to generating a database table whose structure matches the data model declared in the app.<br>
The following command should be run whenever a new model is declared. 
python manage.py makemigrations
migrate
This command option of manage.py synchronizes the database state with the currently declared models and migrations. 
python manage.py migrate<br>
DEBUG = True

By default, the development server runs in debug mode. This helps develop the application as the server picks up changes in the code and the output can be refreshed without restarting.<br>
 However, it must be disabled in the production environment.<br>
